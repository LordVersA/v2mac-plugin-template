# V2Mac Sandbox plugin API, version 1

A plugin is one app that runs in a V2Mac mini VM and shows on the Mac as its own app
(`<Name> — <Mini VM>.app`). Every mini VM has its own exit server and can't reach the Mac, other
mini VMs or the network except through that exit.

## plugin.json

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `api` | yes | `1`. Additive only: a V2Mac that knows an older api hides the plugin. |
| `id` | yes | Letters, digits, `.` and `-`, at most 64. Stays the same across versions. |
| `name`, `version` | yes | Shown to the user. `name` at most 64 characters. |
| `display` | yes | `pty`: opens in the user's Terminal. `gui`: its own window. |
| `launch.cmd` | yes | The command, as a list (no shell unless you run one). |
| `launch.env` | no | Extra environment, `NAME: value` (no newlines). |
| `permissions` | no | Any of `clipboard`, `shared`, `ssh-agent`; the user approves them at install. |
| `publisher`, `changelog`, `securityNotes` | no | Publisher, release notes and permission rationale for store review. |
| `description` | no | One or two sentences on what the app does, shown in the V2Mac Store window. |
| `icon` | no | SVG filename in the plugin folder, uploaded as a release asset. At most 64 KB, plain shapes and gradients only (`path`, `rect`, `circle`, `g`…, at most 1000 elements): no `use`, text, images, `style`, scripts, DOCTYPE or references other than `url(#id)`. The store copies it into its signed index; V2Mac shows it in the store and frames it in the mini VM's colour as the Mac app's icon. Without one, the app gets its initial. |
| `settings` | no | Reserved; ignored by api 1. |
| `from`, `source`, `layers` | filled in | Written by `Scripts/package.sh` at release; don't edit them. |

## What the runtime gives your app

- A home (`/root`) on the mini VM's disk, or in memory when the mini VM is Disposable.
- `/run/v2mac/exit.json`: `ip`, `country`, `city`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `timezone` of the
  mini VM's exit. Read-only; replaced atomically when the exit changes (watch the folder with inotify).
- `TZ`: the exit's time zone at launch.
- `~/Shared` (currently `gui` only, with `shared`): `~/V2Mac Sandbox/<Mini VM>/Shared` on the Mac. What you write
  there is marked as downloaded (quarantine).
- Clipboard (only with `clipboard`, `gui`): the Mac's text reaches you on ⌘V; your copies reach the
  Mac. The user can switch either direction off per mini VM.
- `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` (only with `ssh-agent`, `pty`): the Mac's ssh-agent while your app is open.
- `gui` apps run under sway (fullscreen, no decorations) at the window's size; `pty` apps get a real
  terminal with resize and signals.

Nothing else: no vsock, no firewall or route changes, no other mini VMs, no Mac paths. Your
container runs rootless with no capabilities, a read-only root and a seccomp profile.

## Building

`Containerfile` must start `ARG BASE` / `FROM ${BASE}`; `base.txt` names the released base image
(`base-cli` for `pty`, `base-gui` for `gui`, which brings GTK, fonts, PipeWire and the display tools).
Install packages from Debian's archive only. `Scripts/package.sh . "$(cat base.txt)" <url prefix>`
builds the image, saves it and writes `dist/plugin.json`; the release workflow does this at a tag.
For archive and Docker names, the packager accepts 1–64 ASCII letters, digits, dots or hyphens in
`id` and `version`, starting with a letter or digit. Run
`python3 -m unittest discover -s Tests -p '*_test.py'` for its boundary checks.

Each `layers` entry currently holds a complete `docker save` archive, including the base. The
runtime loads it with Podman; individual OCI blobs are not separate downloads yet. The signed
index pins the archive's exact bytes. Submission CI checks `from` against the store's `bases.json`;
the helper checks it against the base list bundled with its own release. Review the Containerfile
at the pinned source commit too: a manifest's `from` declaration alone does not prove ancestry.

## Local testing

For platform development before GHCR images are released, run `Scripts/build-images.sh` in the
sandbox repo. Its `out/images/bases.json` lists local references such as
`base-cli@sha256:<image id>`. From this repo, package a sample with:

```sh
Scripts/package.sh hello-pty 'base-cli@sha256:<image id>' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8765 https://github.com/your-name/your-plugin <commit>
```

Use the resulting manifest and archive in a local index signed with a throwaway Ed25519 test key.
Build the helper after the base images so it bundles that base list. Serve the index, signature and
archive on loopback, then launch **V2MacDev** with `V2MAC_SANDBOX_STORE=http://127.0.0.1:8765/`
and `V2MAC_SANDBOX_STORE_KEY=<base64 public key>`. Add the plugin through that store. Never use the
production store's signing key for a test. A clean-Mac install remains a release check.

From Folder only reads `plugin.json` and runs on the guest rootfs; it does not build the Containerfile
or copy files into the image. Use it only for commands already present there. The template's
`start.sh` needs the packaged image.
